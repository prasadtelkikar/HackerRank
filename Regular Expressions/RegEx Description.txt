Regular expressions

search for the word 'elvis' followed on the same line by the word 'alive'
    - \belvis\b.*\balive\b  = \b word boundary
                            = . Any character than \n
                            = * zero or more occurrences
                            
Determine a valid mobile number
lets take an example where mobile number is of 7 digits and it should be in XXX-XXXX format
where X is digit
Find seven digit mobile number
    - \b\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d\b  = \b Word boundary
                           = \d match any single digit
                           = - no special symbol
we can write above format in better sense
    - \b{3}\d-{4}\d\b      = {3} followed by "\d" means "Repeat the preceding character for 3 times"

Special characters (^ and $)
    - Special characters used when we want to validate expressions 
    - Something that must be starts at the beginning ^
    - something that ends with $
    
    
\ (backslash):
    - \ backslash uses to remove the special meaning
    - if we want to use ^ in regex string then use \^ instead of ^
    
    
Repetation
some syntax used to repeat entire subexpression
    - * Repeat any number of times
    - + Repeat one or more times
    - ? repeat zero or one times
    - {n} Repeat n times
    - {n, m} Repeat atleast n times, but not more than m times
    - {n,} Repeat atleast n times
    
    \b for word boundary
    
    * for zero or more occcurences
    + for one or more occurences
    . any character
    
    \d for matching single digit
    \w for matching single alphabet
    \s for matching white space
    
    ^ match the beginning of the string
    $ match the end of the string
Examples:
\ba\w*\b = Find word which starts with above

\b\d+\b = Find number which contains atleast one digit

\b{6}\w\b = Find word of length 6
